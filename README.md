# AGameAboutBigNumbers
This is a game about big numbers, inspired by Ordinal Markup.

Each number grows higher and higher, but progression starts slowly. Also I need to deprecate the FactorShift function, because it's useless and broken.

Each prestige layer grows at a reduced rate compared to other prestige layers. This initially seems normal, but then each layer has a sudden extreme timewall. But you can chip away at the timewall using revolutionary technology.
